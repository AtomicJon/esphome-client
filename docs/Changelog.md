# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project tries to use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 1.3.0 (2025-01-22)
  * New feature: extended entity metadata parsing. The `entities` event now includes all fields from ListEntities responses - things like `icon`, `deviceClass`, `unitOfMeasurement`, `stateClass`, `supportedColorModes`, `effects`, `options`, and capability flags. Each of the 22 entity types now has a dedicated TypeScript interface with type-specific properties.
  * New feature: exported entity types and enums for consumers. You can now import `Entity`, `SensorEntity`, `LightEntity`, etc., along with enums like `EntityCategory`, `StateClass`, `NumberMode`, and `TextMode`.
  * Improvement: schema-driven entity parsing. Entity field definitions are now centralized in the schema system, making future protocol changes easier to maintain.
  * Improvement: better error logging when entity discovery fails due to missing required fields.
  * Housekeeping.
